Your favorite childhood toy might have been a dollhouse, a stuffed animal, or a set of blocks. Some toys are specifically designed for play, like a small wooden train set or a baby's shape sorter. You can also make toys out of everyday objects and materialsâ€”a piece of paper can take the shape of a toy airplane, and a saucepan can become a toy drum. Very small dogs are another kind of toy, like a toy poodle. When you use it as a verb, toy means "move or handle absent-mindedly."</p>
